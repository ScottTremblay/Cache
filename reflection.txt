Jake Rosen and Scott Tremblay worked together for P5
We worked very well together and felt that we were able to divide up work equally
and in a way that allowed us to do efficient work. 

We used the method of one of us writing code and the other person
helping strategize. This was the best method due to the fact that
we were only working on one method. 

Overall it was a good experience and we both felt the workload was 
equally shared and was fair.
